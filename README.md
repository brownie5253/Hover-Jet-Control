# Hover-Jet-Control
This is a feedback control system designed to enable a jet with downward thrust to move from any initial point to any destination point on a 2d plane. 
This solution explores both continuous and discreet control design and how the parameters can affect its control response. Simulink model are used to 
create the control systems representing the jets. Main is the file to execute to run the simuation and in parameters is where the start and end positions
can be changed.

A video of the output animation is available
